# Object-Detection-YOLOv7-MaskRCNN

The primary objective of this project is to leverage the power of YOLO and Mask-RCNN object
detection models, along with a trained CNN, to automate the detection and classification of plant
diseases. 

By enabling early identification and intervention, the project aims to contribute to
improved crop health monitoring and effective disease management practices.
